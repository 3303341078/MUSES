## üí° Motivation

Despite recent advancements in text-to-image generation, most existing methods struggle to create images with multiple objects and complex spatial relationships in 3D world. To tackle this limitation, we introduce a generic AI system, namely MUSES, for 3D-controllable image generation from user queries.

##  Method

Our MUSES realize 3D controllable image generation by developing a progressive workflow with three key components, including 
1. Layout Manager for 2D-to-3D layout lifting
2. Model Engineer for 3D object acquisition and calibration
3. Image Artist for 3D-to-2D image rendering

By mimicking the collaboration of human professionals, this multi-modal agent pipeline facilitates the effective and automatic creation of images with 3D-controllable objects, through an explainable integration of top-down planning and bottom-up generation. 

<!-- Additionally, we find that existing benchmarks lack detailed descriptions of complex 3D spatial relationships of multiple objects. To fill this gap, we further construct a new benchmark of T2I-3DisBench (3D image scene), which describes diverse 3D image scenes with 50 detailed prompts.  -->
